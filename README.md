#Some of the advantages of using Node.js for writing server side code are:

#JavaScript on the server: use the same programming language and paradigm for both client and server. This minimizes context switching and makes it easy to share code between the client and the server.

#Single-threaded: removes the complexity involved in handling multiple threads.

#Asynchronous: can take full advantage of the processor itâ€™s running on. This matters because the node process will be running on a single CPU.

#Npm repository: access the largest ecosystem of useful libraries (most of them free to use) in the form of npm modules.
